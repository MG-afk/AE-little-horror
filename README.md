Environmental Puzzle Implementation
The "one room horror" puzzle focuses on three main elements:

Swords
Candelabras
Skulls

Players can move around the scene and interact with these objects to solve the puzzle.
Features Implemented

First-person player movement and interaction system
Object interaction mechanics
Basic puzzle progression tracking
Horror atmosphere elements:

Sound design
Simple visual effects

## Future Improvements
Given more time, I would implement the following improvements:

Audio Management:

Create a source generation system for audio files with enum typing for safer referencing


Puzzle System:

Develop an editor for the riddle system with global constants
Improve flexibility for future puzzle expansions


Player Experience:

Enhance player movement to better fit the horror atmosphere
Implement proper sound mixing
Expand UI elements and interactions


Visual Enhancements:

More advanced shader effects
Additional VFX for interactions
Dynamic lighting changes tied to puzzle progression
